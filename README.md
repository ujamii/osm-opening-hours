Parser for the [Openstreetmap opening hours format](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours) as connector for the library 
[`spatie/opening-hours`](https://github.com/spatie/opening-hours).

## Installation

`composer require ujamii/osm-opening-hours`

## Usage

```php
$hours = OsmStringToOpeningHoursConverter::openingHoursFromOsmString('Mo-Sa 10:00-18:00');
$hours->isOpenAt(new \DateTimeImmutable('2022-01-10 16:00:00')); // true, this is a monday
$hours->isOpenAt(new \DateTimeImmutable('2022-03-06 16:00:00')); // false, as this is a sunday
```

There are a lot more methods on the `$hours` object, please check the [docs](https://github.com/spatie/opening-hours#usage) of that library.
Of course, you can also use some more complex input like (please also check the [docs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours))
and the list of missing features below to see what's actually possible:

```
Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00,13:00-17:30; Sa 08:00-12:00
Sa 08:00-12:00; Mo 11:30-17:00; Tu 11:30-18:00; Dec 23-31 off; Jan 24 off; Oct 10 off; PH off; Apr 16 off
```

If you also need to support the public holiday feature (like `PH off` in the example above), you have to pass in a filter like this:

```php
$hours = OsmStringToOpeningHoursConverter::openingHoursFromOsmString('Mo-Su 10:00-18:00; PH 09:00-12:00', ['PH' => new GermanPublicHolidayFilter()]);
$hours->isOpenAt(new \DateTimeImmutable('2022-01-10 16:00:00')); // true, open late on normal day
$hours->isOpenAt(new \DateTimeImmutable('2022-01-01 16:00:00')); // false, closed late on holiday
$hours->isOpenAt(new \DateTimeImmutable('2022-01-01 11:00:00')); // true, open early on holiday
```

The filter for German holidays is [included already](src/Filters/GermanPublicHolidayFilter.php), so please take at look at this and
the [corresponding interface](src/Filters/Filter.php), if you want to implement something specific for you. The expected config array
may look like `['PH' => new GermanPublicHolidayFilter()]` where the key `PH` has to match the beginning of the ruleset in the given OSM string
and the value is an instance of your filter class. 
Input values like `PH 09:00-12:00` or `PH off` will be parsed and given to the filter in the `setOpeningHours` method. The `spatie/opening-hours`
library will call the `applyFilter(\DateTimeImmutable $date)` method internally when something like `isOpenAt` is requested.

## Running tests

You can run the tests with `composer run phpunit` or `composer run testall` for test and static analysis.

## Known issues / missing features

- the `spatie/opening-hours` library does not support different settings for a weekday based on the week (like
  `week 01-53/2 Fr 09:00-12:00; week 02-52/2 Fr 14:00-18:00`), so we have to add this information via the data
  attribute which the library supports for each given opening hour value (this may be solved by another filter)
- constraint features like years, year_range, year, months, monthdays and week_range are not or not completely supported. This may
  also be solved by the filter feature later
- things like `week 14-24` and `week 1,3,7,34` are not supported yet
- the OSM input string is not validated yet
- No support for constrained weekdays yet `Th[1,2-3], Fr[-1]`
- No support for calculations yet `Sa[-1],Sa[-1] +1 day`
